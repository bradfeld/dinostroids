# Dinoroids

A classic arcade-style shooter game built with HTML Canvas and pure JavaScript, done entirely with vibe coding in Cursor.

## Gameplay

*   **Objective:** Survive as long as possible by shooting asteroids and avoiding collisions.
*   **Asteroids:** Destroy large asteroids (T-Rex), which break into medium ones (Pterodactyl), which break into small ones (Sauropod). Smaller asteroids are worth more points.
*   **Scoring:** Earn points for each asteroid destroyed.
*   **Levels:** Clear all asteroids on the screen to advance to the next level, which introduces more asteroids.
*   **Lives:** You start with a set number of lives. Lose a life if an asteroid hits your ship. Gain an extra life every 10,000 points.
*   **Game Over:** The game ends when you run out of lives.
